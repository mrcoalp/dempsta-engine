# Contributing

### Thanks for taking the time to contribute to `Dempsta` :)
How to do it mostly depends on the type of contribution:

* If you have a question, **please** ensure there isn't already an answer for you by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/mrcoalp/dempsta-engine/issues). Do not forget to search also through the closed ones. If you are unable to find a proper answer, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/mrcoalp/dempsta-engine/issues/new).

* If you found a bug, **please** ensure there isn't already an answer for you by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/mrcoalp/dempsta-engine/issues). If you are unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, feel free to [open a new one](https://github.com/mrcoalp/dempsta-engine/issues/new). **Please**, do not forget to carefully describe how to reproduce the problem, then add all the information about the system on which you are experiencing it.

* If you found a bug and you wrote a patch to fix it, open a new [pull request](https://github.com/mrcoalp/dempsta-engine/pulls) with your code. Add some tests to avoid regressions in future if possible, it would be really appreciated. Please run the check script before submitting it.

* If you want to propose a new feature and you know how to code it, **please** do not issue directly a pull request. Before you do it, [create a new issue](https://github.com/mrcoalp/dempsta-engine/issues/new) to discuss your proposal. Other users could be interested in your idea and the discussion that will follow can refine it and therefore give us a better solution.
